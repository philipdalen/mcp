        ## ✨ Thanks for suggesting a feature!
        
        We love hearing ideas from our community! Your suggestions help us build a better server for everyone. 🚀
        
        **Pro tip:** The more context you provide, the better we can understand and prioritize your request! 🎯

    attributes:
      label: 🎯 What feature would you like?
      description: A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see
      placeholder: |
        Example: "Add support for Teamwork's Milestones API to create, update, and manage project milestones through the MCP server."

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: problem-statement
    attributes:
      label: 🤔 What problem does this solve?
      description: Explain the problem or use case this feature would address
      placeholder: |
        Example: "Currently, there's no way to manage project milestones through the MCP server. Our team needs to track project phases and deadlines, but we have to use the REST API directly, which is more complex and error-prone."

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed-solution
    attributes:
      label: 💡 How should it work?
      description: Describe your ideal solution or how you envision this feature working
      placeholder: |
        Example: "Add a new 'milestones' package with functions like:
        • milestones.Create(ctx, engine, request) - Create a new milestone
        • milestones.List(ctx, engine, projectID) - List project milestones  
        • milestones.Update(ctx, engine, request) - Update milestone details
        • milestones.Delete(ctx, engine, milestoneID) - Delete a milestone"

      label: 🌐 Teamwork API support
      description: Does the Teamwork API already support this feature?
      options:
        - label: Yes, this feature exists in the Teamwork REST API
        - label: No, this would be a new feature for both the API and MCP server
        - label: I'm not sure if the API supports this
        - label: This is MCP-specific (not related to API endpoints)

      label: 🔄 What alternatives have you considered?
      description: Are there other ways to solve this problem? What are the pros/cons?
      placeholder: |
        Example: "We considered using the raw HTTP client to call the API directly, but:
        • It requires more boilerplate code
        • We lose type safety
        • Error handling is more complex
        • We have to manage serialization ourselves"

      label: 🎪 Real-world use case
      description: Tell us about your specific use case - this helps us understand the importance
      placeholder: |
        Example: "We're building an internal tool that syncs project data between Teamwork and our ERP system. We need to create milestones automatically when certain business events occur (like contract signing, delivery dates, etc.). Our team processes about 50 projects per month, so automation is crucial."
